Let us see how a grid layout can

2
00:00:03,316 --> 00:00:05,433
be created in Pali App Studio

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,776
This offers a grid-based layout system, with rows

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,752
and columns, making it easier to design web pages

5
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:14,728
 without having to use floats and positioning

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,342
Created column line

7
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:15,885


8
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:16,427


9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,757
Row line also created. Thank you
